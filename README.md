# PSO2-Dictionary
Bridging two communities together.

### Preface

**PHANTASY STAR ONLINE 2 has finally reached the shores of North America!**

After 7 long years at the time of writing this, North America can finally experience what those of us who have started on the Japanese servers have done so since 2012, such an exciting time to be alive!

As you or anyone may have known while reading this, majority of the English community for PSO2 on the Japanese servers do not speak/read Japanese. 
Thus to combat that problem, an unofficial English fan translation was developed to allow English speaking fans to enjoy the game overseas. 
However, due to PSO2 finally reaching the shores of North America, the localization team behind the North American servers have major differences in translations that naturally differ from the 
fan translation. Because of this, the terminology between the two servers are immensely different. 
So unless a player has previously used the fan translation  patch on the Japanese servers, anyone using English community guides that were written for 
the Japanese servers, will be confused by the terminology differences. 

This dictionary aims to bridge a gap between the two servers, thus allowing for the two communities to enjoy resources available to their fullest extent.
